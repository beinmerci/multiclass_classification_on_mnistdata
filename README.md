# spot check on multiclass classification algorithms using estimator score method 

Data:  MNIST Data


Problem Type : Identify which algorithms are best suited for current dataset for multiclass classification

    
Evaluation Method used: Estimator score method
Estimators have a score method providing a default evaluation criterion for the problem they are designed to solve. This is not discussed on this page, but in each estimatorâ€™s documentation.
